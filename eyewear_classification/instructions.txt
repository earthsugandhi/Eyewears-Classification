Hi, in this video i will demonstrate how to run my application...

1)- use link to my github repository and download everything from it
2)- copy link to the directory where you have saved the folder from
    github
3)- now open jupyter notebook using anaconda
    I have opened jupyter notebook in same director where i had my 
    downloaded files.
4)- here, you can find two notebooks named 'Model_Train' and 'app'
    'Model_Train' contains my code for making ML model and the 
    evaluation matrices
    'app' contains code for my web application
5)- now you have to change the path variable to the directory link 
    which you copied in step 2.
    Now you are ready to use these files. please ensure that to run 
    these files you have python on your machine and have libraries:
    tensorflow, keras, numpy, panadas, sklearn, and other which are in 
    my notebooks.
6)- Now, open 'app' and run the cells
7)- you can see my model making process from 'Model_Train' notebook

Thank You
